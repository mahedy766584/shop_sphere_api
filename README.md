## About

This repository contains the backend server for a multi-seller e-commerce platform. It is built with pragmatic production practices in mind: proper authentication, role-based access control, audit logging, notification system, seller shops, product inventory, cart/order flows, and extensible modular code structure.

This project is tailored to be a hire-worthy portfolio piece for backend developers and showcases real-world concerns like security, observability, and multi-tenant-ish seller isolation.
