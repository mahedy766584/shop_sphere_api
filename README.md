## 🧩 About

This repository contains the backend server for a multi-seller e-commerce platform. It is built with pragmatic production practices in mind: proper authentication, role-based access control, audit logging, notification system, seller shops, product inventory, cart/order flows, and extensible modular code structure.

This project is tailored to be a hire-worthy portfolio piece for backend developers and showcases real-world concerns like security, observability, and multi-tenant-ish seller isolation.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based Authentication** — secure access & refresh token mechanism for seamless session management.  
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** — predefined roles: `admin`, `seller`, and `user` with tiered permissions and route protection.  

### 🏬 Multi-Seller & Shop Management
- **Multi-seller architecture** — each seller owns and manages their own shop and inventory independently.  
- **Seller inventory control** — create, update, and track products under individual shops.  
- **Seller onboarding flow** — user can apply to become a seller, reviewed and approved by admin.  

### 🛍️ Product & Category Management
- **Full Product CRUD** — add, edit, delete, and view products with category & tag association.  
- **Advanced Search & Filters** — keyword search, category filtering, sorting, and pagination (MongoDB text index powered).  
- **Slug-based unique identifiers** — SEO-friendly product and category URLs.  

### 🛒 Cart & Order Lifecycle
- **Persistent Shopping Cart** — items remain synced with user sessions.  
- **Order Workflow Management** — full lifecycle support:  
  `Pending → Processing → Shipped → Delivered → Cancelled`  
- **Payment-ready model design** — structured to easily integrate payment gateways (Stripe).  

### 🔔 Notifications & Audit Logging
- **Smart Notification System** — persistent and event-driven (order updates, admin alerts, seller approvals).  
- **Audit Logs** — track critical system events: user actions, order updates, role changes, and login attempts.  

### 🖼️ Media & Uploads
- **Image Upload Pipeline** — integrated with Cloudinary (optional) or local storage via multer.  
- **Optimized file handling** — secure file validation, MIME checks, and error handling.  

### 🧰 Data Integrity & Validation
- **Input Validation** — powered by Zod schemas for runtime safety.  
- **Sanitized DB interactions** — prevents injection and XSS vulnerabilities.  
- **Soft delete & data consistency** — smart deletion logic to maintain referential integrity.  

### ⚡ Performance & Developer Experience
- **Pagination & Search Optimization** — query performance tuned for large datasets.  
- **Centralized Error Handling** — unified API response format.  
- **Environment-based Configuration** — dev, staging, and production config isolation. 

### 🧪 Quality & Testing
- **Unit & Integration Tests** — Jest + Supertest setup for API testing.  
- **CI/CD Ready** — easy integration with GitHub Actions for automated lint, build, and test pipelines.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This backend server is built using a modern, scalable, and industry-ready technology stack, ensuring performance, security, and maintainability.

### **Language**

* **TypeScript** — strongly-typed JavaScript for safer, more reliable, and maintainable codebases.

### **Runtime & Framework**

* **Node.js** — event-driven, non-blocking runtime optimized for high-performance APIs.
* **Express.js** — minimal and flexible web framework for building RESTful APIs.

### **Database & ORM**

* **MongoDB** — NoSQL database optimized for scalability and flexibility.
* **Mongoose** — ODM for schema validation, relationships, and query optimization.

### **Authentication & Security**

* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** — secure access and refresh token strategy.
* **bcrypt** — robust password hashing for secure credential storage.
* **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** — fine-grained authorization system.

### **Validation & Data Integrity**

* **Zod** (preferred) / **Joi** — runtime schema validation for request payloads.
* Enforces type-safety and prevents invalid data persistence.

### **Caching & Performance**

* **Redis (optional)** — in-memory caching for sessions, rate limiting, and performance optimization.

### **File Storage & Media Handling**

* **Cloudinary (optional)** — cloud-based image hosting & optimization pipeline.
* **Multer** — secure file uploads with MIME-type validation.

### **Logging & Monitoring**

* **Winston** — structured, configurable logging system.
* **Morgan** — HTTP request logging middleware for Express.
* Easily integratable with centralized log management tools (e.g., ELK / Datadog).

### **Testing & Quality Assurance**

* **Jest** — unit and integration test framework.
* **Supertest** — HTTP assertions for end-to-end API testing.

### **CI/CD & Automation**

* **GitHub Actions** — automated pipelines for linting, testing, building, and deployment.
* Supports multi-environment workflows (dev, staging, production).

### **Containerization & Deployment**

* **Docker & Docker Compose** — containerized environment for portability and consistency.
* Production-ready setup for scalable deployments on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, or DigitalOcean).
